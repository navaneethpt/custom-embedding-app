Cloud Computing Services Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides comprehensive cloud computing services.
AWS S3 is a highly scalable object storage service for storing and retrieving data.
AWS EC2 offers virtual machine instances for compute resources.
AWS Lambda enables serverless computing for running code without managing servers.

Microsoft Azure offers similar cloud services to AWS.
Azure Blob Storage is equivalent to AWS S3 for object storage.
Azure Virtual Machines provide compute instances like EC2.
Azure Functions compete with AWS Lambda for serverless workloads.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is another major cloud provider.
GCP Cloud Storage is their object storage solution similar to S3 and Blob Storage.
Google Compute Engine provides virtual machine instances.
Cloud Functions enable serverless computing on GCP.

All three providers offer database services.
AWS RDS provides relational database management.
Azure SQL Database offers managed database services.
Google Cloud SQL provides managed MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Container orchestration is important for modern applications.
Kubernetes is widely used for container management.
AWS EKS, Azure AKS, and GCP GKE all provide managed Kubernetes services.

Storage options include object storage, block storage, and file storage.
S3, Blob Storage, and Cloud Storage are object storage services.
EBS, Azure Disks, and Persistent Disks provide block storage.
EFS, Azure Files, and Filestore offer file storage solutions.
